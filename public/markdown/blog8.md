Money should be the part of life, not the life itself. 

It better to understand and question, **why are we actually saving this ?, what should be relation with it ?, should we spend all life just to have only money ? , what can you do when you have it ?, how much is enough ??**

For spending limited time on this mysterious earth, our body need basic things for e.g. food, place to sleep etc. in case of animals in forest there is no system, so they can fight and get food or land and leave all other things to nature itself. But for human we do live in predefined system ( like living in a country then its rule etc. ). We can't do the same things like animals ( but some do though :( ).Previously we used to have barter system, like i need food, i can give you some other thing or can help you ( give my time ) etc. But now we have unified it with money ( assume as counts value increase with quantity). So now i can give someone money, they can give me food and they can have something else with that money.


- So Yes it is important to have money for our needs and desires. There is very [good pyramid ](https://mudassarsabri.blogspot.com/2015/06/abraham-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs.html) related to need (  Maslow's ).

- Desires are never ending, according to your desire you need the quantity of money. 

- Interesting thing is that, money is not completedly bounded with time ( Let say time here is 80 years for you, because time is fixed, limited and can't be back ). 

- It means you can earn lots of ( relative, but as per your need ) money in less time also ( Altogether separate topic , how to earn money ).
    - On the basis of this, there is concept of financial independence: no one wants his life to be spend for just only money, since time always moving.
    - As per your need and desire, you can earn money that much, so that you need not to do things against your will for earning money. 
    - Time at which you become financial independence is indirectly proportion of amount of money for whole life. 
    - If you don't want to earn money after 30 years of age, then you need more money then any other who want to be at 40.
    - So yup., no need to do things only for money whole life. 
    - Also saving also the part of this, after that you can enjoy with that money completely if you still earning , not need to save at all.

- Money is something with which you can exchange any things, every one has money tag. ( Except few things: health etc ).


Cautions: 

- Having more quantity of money is like trading with the time of your life. So its important to have vision of your life. Interesting thing, vision can be anything not tight to something. 
- Desire are unlimited, either you'll require to earn a lot for that or you need to have less desire. Its a trade off of your priorities. You can have few desire for which you can balance. 
- Health is inversely proprotion to age of yourself. Some time its better to have some experiences rather than saving aggresively. 
- **Best state is when you are somehow doing the things you enjoy, want, desire, admire ( which other think to do after financial independence ) in this precious and limited time on this beautiful earth and also getting money in exchange ( which is enough for you ) as well.**
- **Having said this, things get tough when you desire something and you might not get money in return of that** . Each individual can have different approach for this.


Try now or never regret at all about past **at last**. Period
