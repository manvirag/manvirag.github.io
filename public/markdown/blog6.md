Life often presents us with moments of intense emotional fluctuation. Whether it's due to work stress, personal relationships, or major life changes, these emotional rollercoasters can be challenging to navigate. Here's a thoughtful model as per my 2025 understanding.

### notice;

just remember emotions are not our enemy. Emotions like anxiety, sadness, overwhelmed, feeling left out, or not enjoying life etc. 

When emotions hit hard, the first step is to ***notice*** what you are experiencing. For example, you might feeling that life isn’t as fun as it used to be, or you feel like you’re missing out on everything—this is often called FOMO, might also feel that overwhelming sense of looseness, where nothing seems to hold any meaning, or simply a heavy feeling that makes it hard to enjoy your day. 

Take a moment and say to yourself, ***Right now, I feel overwhelmed (or other high emotion) and I’m not enjoying life as I usually do.*** Just ***noticing these feelings helps you see them clearly***, like recognizing a sign on a road that tells you where you are.




### pause; don't make decisions, if possible

Think of [Anger, the Boy and the Fence](https://www.alphahome.org/anger-the-boy-and-the-fence/) => a little boy with a bad temper was given a bag of nails by his father. Every time he lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence. At first, he hammered many nails, and each nail left a hole in the fence—just like harsh words or angry outbursts leave lasting scars. Even when he learned to control his anger and removed the nails for the days he held his temper, the holes remained. This shows that while emotions are natural, acting on them without care can leave marks that are hard to fix.

When feelings high, may be you feel overwhelmed by the thought of missing out, or you feel loose or disconnected or anxiety etc. it's important to stop before making any big decisions. For instance, if you're about to send a heated text or react impulsively at work, ask yourself, ***"Am I in the right state to decide or act now?" Taking a pause gives you a moment to step back from the rush of emotion.*** . A/c to my experience better to not do , when its first, pospond that decision for later.

### not escape, else you'll end up in endless loop. Instead feel and find root cause pattern;

Once you have noticed your overwhelming emotion, the next step is to be calm , relax and feel it fully. Remind yourself that feeling uncomfortable is part of being human ( but make sure don't stuck in loop of same emotions ), and that you can sit with these feelings without needing to fix them right away.

Make sure not escape this hard phase of high emotion by distraction like social media scrolling, seeing youtube video etc. Since by doing these things you will feel good ( dopamine ), and you'll forgot about those emotions and this could result into habit, but issue is that same thing will happen again and you'll end up in a dark loop, as much you ignore as it will become problematic. ( a/c to me if its first time, then might skip, if twice then don't do . )

When we say feel , means absorb that feeling and ask yourself, what does this feeling is ? how it coming ? what's the trigger point ? What is this feeling showing me? Is there a need to adjust something in my life or learn from this experience?" This helps you see that even strong emotions can offer useful signals about your needs or values ( In short you need to feel emotions and find root cause ). 

( Lets say ( very random example ) if your are feeling very overwhelm when you went outside of your home to deal with new people, absorb that high emotions and remind that its ok to feel like this and every time you feel like this then sit quietly think about that why you feel that ? is that you feel inferiority complex ? is that you lack some skills ? is that someone constantly disrespecting you ? )


### reset your mind; take it easy; 

Finally, move toward what matters. Choose a small, positive action that aligns with your values. 

This could be as simple as ignore this emotion and drinking a glass of water, sending a quick message to a friend, or taking a short walk because that was unnecessary. Or on basic principle => map your minds to some action for feeling  , it could be ignoring or could be to solve that emotions.

For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of social media or the fear of missing out then ->  decide to put your phone aside and write a quick note about something you're grateful for, tell you mind positive thought for e.g. 

in this case you can say -> 
- the things you are grateful for while others not, 
- what we see isn't always true,  
- comparision is always endless( people below ( not mean, it means some quality you have and they want to get it ) aim to you, you aiming to someone else, someone else aiming to some other else etc. ), 
- if you really want that ? than compromising other things ? if not ignore it, if you want it in life time ? take some actions or note down for later ( like of dynamic programming or state management :< ) if you not want it immediately, 
- tell mind you can't be distracting to multiple things complete first or leave it permanently previous one then come on it. 
- is it really matters to you ? :), 

Its bit hard but very satify , once you note down thing its like very helpful to your mind , depending upon situations can have different solutions.

These small steps help redirect energy from the heavy feelings toward actions that improve your day.
