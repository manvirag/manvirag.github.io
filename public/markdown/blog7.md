Life is full of lessons hard to experience all, **one of the most valuable is to listen to advice from those who have already traveled the road you are on**. People who have achieved success often carry with them a lots of experiences, mistakes, and insights that can help you avoid pitfalls and make better decisions. You **need not to experience ( failure mostly ) everything for yourself, but you can learn from others who had faced similar challenges**.

For example, imagine you are starting a small business. Many successful entrepreneurs/businessman have shared stories of their early mistakes and learning. When you listen to these warnings, you save time, effort, and money by avoiding the same errors. The key is to consider these lessons, **check its looks good for your usecase** , have more wiser vision and apply them to your own journey.

However, it is important to remember that **not all advice is useful equally**. The advice you receive should come from people who have started in a similar situation to yours. For instance, if you are starting a something in a rural area, and comparing from someone who built their empire in a city might not always be relevant. The circumstances, challenges, and resources available in each case can be very different. It is **wise to compare your situation or take advice with that of the person, who kind of had similar situations like yours**.

There is an endless stream of opinions and tips available through books, blogs, and social media. The challenge is to filter out what is useful. 

**Listen to only people who really have done it and are genuine, not influencer etc. Quote: "Don't read the book, which author wrote to earn money".**

By doing so, you can build a wiser, more informed approach to your own life challenges.

Listening to advice is **not about following every word blindly**. It is about gathering knowledge, testing it against your own experiences, and making informed decisions. 

In the end, the wisdom of others can guide you, help you avoid costly mistakes, and accelerate your journey toward success, because they have achieved that way.
