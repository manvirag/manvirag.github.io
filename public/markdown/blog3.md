Decision Making is frustrating , some time its end up to overthinking and doing nothing.

How can we make this easy ?

So i thought my not change this thing into a, template or a decision tree, which can be updated more once you try and fail. Or any other question you can ask before jumping to decision.

**Note:**

Before checking this , remember there are many other factors that affect our decision making if those are affecting then we have to fix them first. For e.g.

* Scarcity Mindset:

* Fear of judgement, comfort zone.

* Inferiority Complex.

* Money.

There can be other following, make sure these don’t affect much of your decision. For e.g. if you don’t have any source of income and want to buy something, then its just a waste of time to thinking about it. First do that.
