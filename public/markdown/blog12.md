Burnout isn’t just being tired from doing a lot or you are working very long hour. It’s when the mind feels so drained that even things you normally enjoy start to feel heavy. And You don’t feel like doing anything not even the things you like. The mental exhaustion begins to affect the body too. You now feel slow, low-energy, unmotivated. It’s like your system is stuck in a fog. 

You are very frustrated, stuck, not sure what you are doing, why you are doing, not interested in doing thing, not interested in talking etc.

It’s easy to think burnout comes from working too much. But often, it comes from doing work every day that you don’t actually connect with, work that doesn’t feel good in the moment, but you keep doing it in the hope that someday it will bring a positive result. 

You try one day, you fail. You try again the next day, still no change. You don’t enjoy the process, but you keep pushing because you’re holding on to some future positive change. When that positive change doesn’t come, the whole thing starts to collapse.


Quote: "Burnout has nothing to do with how many hours or how hard you work, It's caused by working for people you don't like towards goals you don't believe in."

.....

Burnout builds when there’s no joy in the doing, no enjoy in surrounding, no enjoy in system, no enjoy in impact, no feeling connected but only hope in the positive change. 

For e.g. You are working on you 9-5 job, you are getting very hard time with teammates or leadership or surrounding any thing, so now you are not enjoying to do the work for them which you were enjoying. Now you are thinking , even though i am not enjoying , but lets do today,  thing will change tomorrow .But nothing changed, you did another day .... its continue now its very hard to continue also hoping for positive having so much failure. Now if you continue you are on path to burnout. 

So whenever things come like this make sure, not going to continue it. It's like going down a well, the deeper you go, the harder it becomes to climb back out.


.....

Take break, take rest, sleep, stop this chain, think with fresh mind, start getting bore and then try things with fresh mind.


.....

Having said this, there are situations where you don't have options. You are obsessed to do the thing which you really like to be happen, but might not that enjoyable as process. Obsessed people do that irrespective of burnout concept.
