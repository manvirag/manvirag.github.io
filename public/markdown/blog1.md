When discussing system design, it’s crucial to understand the key terminologies that underpin the principles and performance of a given system. These terminologies provide a common language for architects and engineers to communicate effectively. Let’s dive into these terms one by one:



### 1. Consistency
This term denotes the need for uniformity in data and operations across a system at any given point in time. In simpler words, it means that all users should see the same data and results.

### 2. Throughput
Throughput measures the total number of operations a system can handle at any given moment. It’s often expressed as the number of requests processed per second, reflecting a system’s capacity for concurrent operations.

### 3. Latency
Latency is the time elapsed between making a request to a system and receiving a response. It directly affects a user’s perception of a system’s speed and responsiveness.

### 4. Scalability
Scalability refers to a system’s ability to handle an increased load by allocating additional resources. In other words, it’s the system’s capacity to expand when needed.

### 5. Efficiency
Efficiency pertains to the system’s ability to achieve optimal results using minimal resources. For example, optimizing algorithms can lead to resource savings.

### 6. Performance
While efficiency focuses on resource optimization, performance encompasses a broader perspective. It considers the overall user experience, including speed, responsiveness, and user satisfaction.

### 7. Replication
Replication involves creating copies of data or components within a system. This practice enhances availability and performance. For example, replicating data “x, x, x” across three servers ensures redundancy.

### 8. Distributed Systems
In contrast to simple replication, distributed systems involve dividing data or components into parts and distributing them across different locations or servers. For example, distributing “x” across three servers as “x/3.”

### 9. Availability
Availability is the measure of the proportion of time a system remains operational and accessible. A highly available system denoted as “99.99% available,” can handle requests even during disruptions.

### 10. Single Point of Failure
This term identifies a component within a system whose failure can potentially lead to the entire system’s breakdown. Eliminating single points of failure is a critical design consideration.

### 11. Reliability
Reliability ensures that a system consistently operates correctly and remains available, even when some of its components fail. It’s about designing for robustness and minimizing downtime.

### 12. Partition Tolerance
Partition tolerance is essential for systems that must continue working during network disruptions. It allows a system to function, even if it means dealing with temporary data inconsistencies.

### 13. Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance goes hand in hand with reliability and partition tolerance. It ensures a system can continue operating despite failures in its individual components.

By understanding and applying these system design terminologies, architects and engineers can build more robust and efficient systems, enhancing user experiences and ensuring uninterrupted operation, even in the face of challenges.
