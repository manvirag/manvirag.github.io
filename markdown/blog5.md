### Dream of Habits, Not Goals

"Don't dream of the goal; dream of the daily habits that will get you there."

#### TL;DR

Dreaming of the end result won't make it happen. Instead, focus on falling in love with the small, consistent actions that your dream do on daily basis.

#### A Tale of Two Dreamers

Imagine two friends, Alex and Sam.

Alex ( **Red Guys** ) dreams of being a software engineer. He imagines the fancy job title, the big salary, and the respect. But he doesn't know what person doing daily basis, is this interesting to him or not. He just wants the end result.

Sam ( **Green Guy** ) dreams of writing code, fixing bugs, and learning new technologies. He loves the process, even when it's hard.

Who do you think , who will  be happy as the software engineer? It's Sam, because he loves the daily work. Alex gives up when he realizes he doesn't enjoy the grind.

#### Breaking It Down

Dreaming of a big goal is like wanting to win a race without wanting to run every day. To achieve anything, you need to love the small, everyday steps that lead to it. If you enjoy the journey, the destination will come naturally. But if you only dream of the result and not the work, you'll likely give up. So, focus on the habits, not just the goal!

#### Final Thought

It's not about having the dream; it's about living the dream every day through your actions. Do you love the process? If yes, the goal will follow. ðŸ˜Š
