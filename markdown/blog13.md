### Understanding Food, Energy, and Health

This note is a simple way to build clarity on how food gives energy, what different nutrients do in the body, and why balance matters. It’s not about giving advice, but just documenting understanding for personal mental models.

###  Calories / Energy

- Calorie is a unit of **energy**. It tells how much energy we get from food.
- All macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, fat) provide calories:
  - 1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 calories
  - 1 gram of protein = 4 calories
  - 1 gram of fat = 9 calories (highest energy)
- So whatever we eat, we get some energy from it this is what is called a calorie.
- There’s a direct relationship between how much energy (calories) a person needs in a day and what is consumed.
- If fewer calories are consumed than required, it's called a **calorie deficit**, and this eventually leads to weight loss. The opposite leads to weight gain.

### Macronutrients : 


### 1. Fat:

- Fat gives energy. It is important for the body and heart. Fat is also required to absorb certain vitamins in the body.
- 25–30% of daily calories should come from fat.

##### Why Fat is Good:

- High energy source → 1g = 9 calories
- Required for vitamin absorption (A, D, E, K)
- Helps in cell building
- Helps increase HDL (good cholesterol) and reduce LDL (bad cholesterol)
  - HDL helps remove LDL by carrying it to the liver, where it is processed and removed from the body.

##### Important Notes:

- Fat should be consumed in moderate quantity and from **good sources** like:
  - Raw almonds
  - Walnuts
  - Natural oils

##### Oil and Cooking:

- Choose oils that are:
  - Not **saturated**
  - Have a **high smoke point** (don't release harmful chemicals when overheated)
  - Prefer **unrefined** over **refined**
    - Refined oils are highly processed, can contain chemicals, and lose nutrients
    - Unrefined oils are made with **minimal processing**, preserving nutrients

### 2. Proteins:

- Adults require about **1 to 1.2 grams per kg of body weight**. For example, around 70–80 grams per day.
- Proteins help the body **repair cells**. Also support the **immune system** and **muscle growth**.
- Deficiency can cause **muscle loss**, **hair fall**, etc.
- Protein provides calories → 1g = 4 calories

##### Protein Sources:

- Chickpeas (chana)
- Tofu
- Sprouts
- Paneer
- Lentils



##### Taking Too Much Protein:

- Excess protein is stored as **fat**
- Produces **urea** (which is excreted through urine), putting pressure on kidneys
  - Healthy kidneys can handle it, but unnecessary risk
- Body needs **more water** to flush out urea, or it may cause **dehydration**
- Too much protein and low fiber can lead to **indigestion**

........

### 3. Carbohydrates:

- Main function: **Provide energy**
- Essential for **brain and body cell functions**
- Like petrol for the body. Carbs break down to **glucose**, which powers cells.
- Carbs are the **first source of energy**. Then comes fat and protein.
- Carbohydrates also provide energy → 1g = 4 calories
- Should be **45–65%** of daily calorie intake.

##### Types of Carbs:

- **Simple (limited):** 
  - Digest easily
  - Short-term energy
  - E.g., sugar, candy

- **Complex (sustainable):**
  - Digest slowly
  - Provide long-term energy
  - E.g., wheat, grains, chickpeas, vegetables

##### Eating Less Carbs:

- Can cause weight loss
- But body starts using **fat and protein** for energy, which is not ideal because:
  - Fat is needed for vitamin absorption
  - Protein is needed for cell repair

##### Eating Excess Carbs:

- Extra carbs are **stored as fat**

........

### 4. Fiber:

- Fiber is a **non-digestible carbohydrate**
- It doesn’t give energy, but is important for:
  - **Digestion**
  - **Controlling blood sugar**
  - **Providing fullness** (prevents overeating)
- Ideal intake: **35–38 grams/day** (for men)

##### Too Little Fiber:

- Causes **digestion issues**
- Leads to **constipation**

##### Too Much Fiber:

- Can cause **gas**, **diarrhea**
- Fiber absorb water, so require to have drink high water. if not can cause indigestion.

##### Fiber Sources:

- Fruits
- Vegetables
- Whole grains

### Micronutrients

Macronutrients (like carbs, proteins, fats) are needed in large amounts for energy and building blocks, while micronutrients (like vitamins, minerals) are needed in smaller amounts for various bodily functions

### 1. Vitamins:

- Not produced by the body, so must be taken through food
- Each vitamin has a **specific function**, and deficiency can have negative effects
- Examples: A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, C, D, E, K
- Required in **small amounts** (micrograms)
- Occasional deficiency is okay, but not consistently
  - The body can store vitamins for some time, but not forever
- Refer to **RDI** (Recommended Dietary Intake) for daily needs

---

### 2. Minerals:

- Like vitamins, they must be taken through food
- Examples:
  - Calcium (bones/teeth)
  - Sodium
  - Iron
  - Zinc
- Required in very small quantities (milligrams/micrograms)
- Should not be consistently skipped

---

### Dictionary / Concepts

- **Nutrients:** Essential substances required for body growth and function
- **Macronutrients:** Needed in large quantities (carbs, protein, fat)
- **Micronutrients:** Needed in small quantities (vitamins, minerals)
- **Bad Fat:** Processed or saturated fats
  - Processed = chemically changed
  - Saturated = e.g., butter; raises LDL cholesterol
  - Both types can block arteries → risk of heart stroke
- **Cold Pressed Oils:** Oils made without or with very low heat
- **Cholesterol:**
  - **LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein):** Bad cholesterol → builds plaque in arteries → heart problems
  - **HDL (High Density Lipoprotein):** Good cholesterol → removes LDL from blood to liver
- **Triglycerides:** Fat found in blood from excess calories → can cause heart disease
- **Metabolism:** Process of converting food (mainly carbs) to energy
- **Blood Sugar:** Glucose level in blood; insulin controls it. Exercise and fiber help maintain it. Avoid excessive sugar.
- **Blood Pressure:**
  - High BP: Caused by age, stress, obesity, salt, genetics
  - Low BP: Caused by dehydration, heart issues, etc.
