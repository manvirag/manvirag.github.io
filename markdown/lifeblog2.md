### Riding Solo Along the Some Konkan Coast Portion: A Journey of Freedom, Fun, and a Few Fumbles ###

*"The fears we don’t face become our limits."*  

These words echoed in my head as I kicked off my first solo bike ride in new place. The idea of venturing alone just me, my bike, and the open road had always been thrilling yet terrifying. What if I got lost? What if something went wrong? But there’s something magical about pushing past those fears.  

Although trip wasn't very long, but it was long for first timer.

### The Route: Twists, Turns, and a Sea Breeze Companion ###



The plan was simple: start early, take the scenic route through Tamini Ghat and reached to srivardhan, explore serene beaches along the Konkan coastline, and eventually loop back home via Lonavala. It was planned for over three days, but alibag was over crowded and not satisfying , but ended up in 2 days. Over two days, I covered coastal roads, villages, ferry and stunning beaches.

### Day 1: From the Tamini Ghats to the Shoreline ###

**Day 1 Map Route**  

![day 1 map route](/markdown/lifeblog2img/day1.png)

[Day 1 complete map route](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FMWqbLesmzrFb8fSA)

I started at 7:00 AM from Pune, and took the NH 753F ( [Spur of NH 53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_753F_(India)#/map/0)) . Via this road, I reached Mhasala, passing through Pirangut, Mulshi, Tamhini, Nizampur, and Mangaon. After this, I took the state highway SH 99 and this led to my first major stop at Srivardhan. Road was very good, buttt also had lots of curve that adds the risk while turning ( after the mulshi to tasgaon, if you see in map ). So had to be very careful here.

Tamihini Ghat:

After reaching Srivardhan, started the search for stays and finally checked into a homestay near to beach, unloaded the gears , and again  hopped back on the bike to roam around the city. My first stop was Srivardhan Beach, a beautiful stretch of sand.  And Then headed to the Harihareshwar Temple and Beach ( Was around 45KM of round trip). I returned back to Srivardhan Beach for the grand finale: the sunset and enjoyed the solitude.

I took out my mini tripod for some solo photos. Setting it up and trying to look natural wasn’t as easy as I thought :).

A few people stared some curious, some amused but who cares. “It’s my sunset, my moment,” I thought as I took the shots. And the photos turned out great!

It was a very fun and tiring day filled with beautiful scenery. I made the most of it.

[Day 2 Complete Map Route](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BwNrED6om5NDLthm8)

The second day took me along the coastal route, hopping from beach to beach, with a final stop planned at Alibaug.  



**Beaches Visited** 

The day started with a stunning sunrise at **Aravi Beach** and its beautiful dream coastal road for biker. Met a guy was also from Pune , came here to play cricket with his Hunter 350, had chat with him and also helped me to took the pic.

Then headed over to Diveagar beach, the route from aravi to **diveagar beach** was also very sceneric. Except the diveagar beach road only , until i again met to 753F. Again met a group of people ( biker ), they were also very kind wished me Happy New year and also helped me to take my pic.

Before reaching NH 753F, i was very skeptical about the roads, since it was going to worse, then i asked about the road with the local shopkeeper, he was also very kind and helped me to confirm and provide the exact acutrate road and told about the conditions of the road upto NH 753F. Finally again reached on NH 753F , it very good road , although not coastal but without patches and wide and finally reached to Dighi, for taking my very first Ferry Hurrah,  I saw these ferry in Japan bike vlogs only <3 . 

![](/markdown/lifeblog2img/devcol3.png)

I reached and took my very **first ferry ( Dighi to Agardanda )**, it was great experience. I took the first ferry at of 9:00 AM, and was not much crowded. Again here met the guy whom with confirmed about the ferry destination, he asked me about solo travelling and where going, had good chit chat with him.

Following that again on the beautiful coastal road, crossing **Janjira Beach**, **Murud Beach**, **Nandagaon Beach** and finally halt at **Kashid Beach** to have brunch. Chilled out for 30-60 mins, enjoyed the food with see views and seeing the group of friends they were enjoying , dancing and making the fun videos.

After that without halt passing through Revdanda, Nagaon fianally reached to Alibaug. I was very exited to go there, since it was famous out of these, as initally i was planning to go first to alibaug and do the reverse trip. 

OMG.....

As someone said **Life without experience and sufferings is not a life**.

Now bad time has started, 

**First Alibaug: Overcrowded, Overwhelming**  

Let’s just say Alibaug was **not** what I had imagined. The sheer crowd made it impossible to find spot on road, and my dreams of a quiet beach lunch were dashed by honking cars and too much crowd, was completely choked and which led to excited went down completely. Even after this i decided to stop there, and somehow reached to my **first Zostel experience** it was very good and affordable to Solo traveller. But i didn't want to stuck in crowd most of time and already experienced the much better beaches ( might not be true , didn't check alibaug beach ) , so decided to back to Pune.

BS!! This Wasn’t Enough

Not all trips go exactly as planned, and mine was no exception. After leaving Alibaug and hitting the highway, things took a turn literally.

**A Sobering Reminder on the Highway**

Somewhere on the highway (I’m not sure of the exact location, it was on 166D), traffic was diverted to a single lane for some time. It wasn’t long before I came across a grim scene—a bike and a car had collided, and the accident had happened just 10–20 minutes before I arrived.

There was a man sitting on the road, bleeding heavily, his cries echoing in the air. He wasn’t wearing a helmet or any protective gear, and the severity of his injuries was a stark reminder of why safety is non-negotiable. I stopped briefly, along with other passersby, and continuing on my way, carrying the weight of that image in my mind **:(** .

**A Close Call in the Ghats**

As I approached the roads between Khopoli and Khandala ( If you look at the map, the road is quite curvy and had also some traffic not as peaceful as the Tamhini ones :( , the terrain became more challenging. While navigating a particularly sharp curve, I confused between two paths. Instinctively, I hit the front brakes on roadside and road had slope, .... TBU may will tell some day.

<!-- and my bike got imbalanced ,since bike was heavy wasn't able to control it and tipped over.

Fortunately, some kind strangers rushed to help me lift the bike. Neither I nor my bike suffered any significant damage (except scratch on crash guard and brake, i checked later), thanks to the crash guard. It could have been much worse, and I was grateful for this small stroke of luck. -->

**A Trail of Abandoned Incidents**

Barely a few minutes after I resumed my ride, I saw another unsettling sight. A car, likely involved in an earlier crash, was abandoned on the side of a sharp turn. It looked new but was now smashed at the front a reminder of how easily things can go wrong if one isn’t cautious.

Not long after, I encountered yet another scene: a biker towing his disabled bike along the same curvy road. The sight was frustrating yet humbling. It made me appreciate that, despite my earlier fall, I could still ride on without major issues.

Chaos in Khandala and Lonavala

As I approached Khandala - Lonavala, traffic became unbearable. The rush was insane, and I found myself navigating through narrow gaps between cars and bikes, trying to stay ahead. In the process, I had a few close calls moments where I might have scratched another car or my own bike and might have fallen.

By the time I left the chaos behind, I was drained physically and mentally. The excitement from the earlier part of the journey had worn off, replaced by a sense of relief just to be heading home.

Every Trip Has Ups and Downs

Not every journey is smooth, and not every plan works out. Trips like these remind us that adventures come with challenges, and those challenges are where we grow.

These incidents taught me a lot about preparation, staying calm in difficult situations, and the importance of being extra cautious. They also reaffirmed the unpredictability of solo travel and how it forces you to adapt, face fears, and keep going, no matter what.

Yes, fear and uncertainty are natural, but so is resilience. It’s this balance the ups and downs that makes travel worthwhile. Every scar on the road adds to the story, and every lesson learned shapes the rider you become.

### Unknown Humans, Known Kindness ###

Everywhere I stopped, strangers greeted me with smiles, offered directions, and even shared a friendly chat. There’s something truly heartwarming about how travel uncovers the kindness in people you’ve never met.

While it's natural to fear trusting the unknown, most people you encounter are genuinely helpful and kind.

That said, I still believe people are generally kind, until circumstances challenge them.

### Life Lessons from the Solo Trip ###

- Overthinking kills the magic. Sometimes, you just need to hit the throttle and go.  
- Fear isn’t the enemy; it’s the teacher. Facing it head-on, you realize how much you’re capable of.  
- Being alone isn’t lonely—it’s empowering. You discover parts of yourself you didn’t know existed.  
- Confidence about independence and discovering. For e.g. now if you see Pune to Goa is 460-500, since i already travelled 240km in one day ( that's also no stretch ), then what the big challenge going goa in 2 days or may be later able to go in one day.
- Hope for the best , prepare for the worst. It's not possible to avoid mishap, what if bike broke down, who could help me etc. These are uncontrollable, but things which are in your control should be done as much as possible. Like have proper gears, bike checked up before trip, planned properly, go in morning planing only upto afternoon etc.
- Still , Solo is bit risky but very enjoyable

### Final Thoughts  

If you’ve been dreaming of a solo trip but fear is holding you back, let me tell you this: the open road has a way of clearing your mind, filling your heart, and teaching you lessons you didn’t even know you needed. Its not necessary to have very very long trip in one go start gradually. 

*"The journey is the destination. Irrespective of any part of life"*  

And what a journey it was.
