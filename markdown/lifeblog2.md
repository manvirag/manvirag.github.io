### Riding Solo Along the Some Konkan Coast Portion: A Journey of Freedom, Fun, and a Few Fumbles ###

*"The fears we don’t face become our limits."*  

These words echoed in my head as I kicked off my first solo bike ride in new place. The idea of venturing alone just me, my bike, and the open road had always been thrilling yet terrifying. What if I got lost? What if something went wrong? But there’s something magical about pushing past those fears.  

Although trip wasn't very long, but it was long for first timer.

### The Route: Twists, Turns, and a Sea Breeze Companion ###



The plan was simple: start early, take the scenic route through Tamini Ghat and reached to srivardhan, explore serene beaches along the Konkan coastline, and eventually loop back home via Lonavala. It was planned for over three days, but alibag was over crowded and not satisfying , but ended up in 2 days. Over two days, I covered coastal roads, villages, ferry and stunning beaches.

### Day 1: From the Tamini Ghats to the Shoreline ###

**Day 1 Map Route**

[Day 1 complete map route](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FMWqbLesmzrFb8fSA)

I started at 7:00 AM from Pune, and took the NH 753F ( [Spur of NH 53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_753F_(India)#/map/0)) . Via this road, I reached Mhasala, passing through Pirangut, Mulshi, Tamhini, Nizampur, and Mangaon. After this, I took the state highway SH 99 and this led to my first major stop at Srivardhan. Road was very good, buttt also had lots of curve that adds the risk while turning ( after the mulshi to tasgaon, if you see in map ). So had to be very careful here.


After reaching Srivardhan, started the search for stays and finally checked into a homestay near to beach, unloaded the gears , and again  hopped back on the bike to roam around the city. My first stop was Srivardhan Beach, a beautiful stretch of sand.  And Then headed to the Harihareshwar Temple and Beach ( Was around 45KM of round trip). I returned back to Srivardhan Beach for the grand finale: the sunset and enjoyed the solitude.

I took out my mini tripod for some solo photos. Setting it up and trying to look natural wasn’t as easy as I thought :).

A few people stared some curious, some amused but who cares. “It’s my sunset, my moment,” I thought as I took the shots. And the photos turned out great!

It was a very fun and tiring day filled with beautiful scenery. I made the most of it.

The second day took me along the coastal route, hopping from beach to beach, with a final stop planned at Alibaug.  



**Beaches Visited** 

The day started with a stunning sunrise at *Aravi Beach* and its beautiful dream coastal road for biker. Met a guy was also from Pune , came here to play cricket with his Hunter 350, had chat with him and also helped me to took the pic.  

Then headed over to Diveagar beach, the route from aravi to *diveagar beach* was also very sceneric. Except the diveagar beach road only until i again met to 753F. Again met a group of people ( biker ), they were also very kind wished me Happy New year and also helped to take my pic.

Before reaching 753F, i was very skeptical about the roads, since it was going to worse, then i asked about the road with the local , he was also very kind and help me to confirm and provide the exact acutrate road and told about the conditions of the road upto 753F. Finally again reached on 753F , it very good road , although not coastal but without patches and wide and finally reached to Dighi, for taking my very first Ferry Hurrah,  I saw these ferry in Japan bike vlogs only <3 . 

I reached and took my very first ferry ( Dighi to Agardanda ), it was great experience. I took the first ferry at of 9:00 AM, and was not much crowded. Again here met the guy whom with confirmed about the ferry destination, he asked me about solo travelling and where going, had good chit chat with him.

Following that again on the beautiful coastal road, crossing *Janjira Beach*, *Murud Beach*, *Nandagaon Beach* and finally halt at *Kashid Beach* to have brunch. Chilled out for 30-60 mins, enjoyed the food with see views and seeing the group of friends they were enjoying , dancing and making the fun videos. 

After that without halt passing through Revdanda, Nagaon fianally reached to Alibaug. I was very exited to go there, since it was famous out of these, as initally i was planning to go first to alibaug and do the reverse trip. 

OMG.....

As someone said **Life without experience and sufferings is not a life**.

Now bad time has started, 

**First Alibaug: Overcrowded, Overwhelming**  

Let’s just say Alibaug was *not* what I had imagined. The sheer crowd made it impossible to find spot on road, and my dreams of a quiet beach lunch were dashed by honking cars and too much crowd, was completely choked and which led to excited went down completely. Even after this i decided to stop there, and somehow reached to my *first Zostel experience* it was very good and affordable to Solo traveller. But i didn't want to stuck in crowd most of time and already experienced the much better beaches ( might not be true , didn't check alibaug beach ) , so decided to back to Pune.

### BS!! This wasn't enough  ###

Now came to more bad part

### Unknown Humans, Known Kindness ###

Everywhere I stopped, strangers greeted me with smiles, offered directions, and even shared a friendly chat. There’s something truly heartwarming about how travel uncovers the kindness in people you’ve never met.

While it's natural to fear trusting the unknown, most people you encounter are genuinely helpful and kind.

That said, I still believe people are generally kind, until circumstances challenge them.

### Life Lessons from the Road ###

- Overthinking kills the magic. Sometimes, you just need to hit the throttle and go.  
- Fear isn’t the enemy; it’s the teacher. Facing it head-on, you realize how much you’re capable of.  
- Being alone isn’t lonely—it’s empowering. You discover parts of yourself you didn’t know existed.  
- Hope for the best , prepare for the worst. It's not possible to avoid mishap, what if bike broke down, who could help me etc. These are uncontrollable, but things which are in your control should be done as much as possible. Like have proper gears, bike checked up before trip, planned properly, go in morning planing only upto afternoon etc.
- Still , Solo is bit risky but very enjoyable

### Final Thoughts  

If you’ve been dreaming of a solo trip but fear is holding you back, let me tell you this: the open road has a way of clearing your mind, filling your heart, and teaching you lessons you didn’t even know you needed. Its not necessary to have very very long trip in one go start gradually. 

*"The journey is the destination. Irrespective of any part of life"*  

And what a journey it was.
