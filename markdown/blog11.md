It was new year , you started with some goals and you added the details of the goal as well, like i want to do this, how can i do this etc. 
Now when the time came to do that, you thought let do that other things , let do this goal tomorrow, now very urgent or let do this next week etc . Now its the end of the year and again the new year , you are setting same goal again. :(. 

You got to know at the end of year you did complete the goals, which could be done in half of the year. if done with focus and urgently.

Urgency doesn't feeling very anxious about the goal completion and all, its about to set up the date or deadline to do the task , here you can take time to setup possible and feasible timeline , but once its set you need to urgently act on it to complete it before deadline. Otherwise you always deprioritise it and that goal which had to be done in 1 week, will take the 1 month to complete. 

Its OK you are setting goals and all, but you need to act on the execution of it.
